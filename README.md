## Problem Description

The problem we are trying to solve is performing predictive maintenance on timeseries data. Predictive maintenance involves analyzing historical data to predict when a machine or equipment is likely to fail, allowing for proactive maintenance to be performed.

## Solution Overview

Our solution for performing predictive maintenance on timeseries data involves the following steps:

1. Data Collection: We collect timeseries data from various sensors and monitoring devices installed on the machines or equipment.

2. Data Preprocessing: The collected data is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and noise. This step may also involve data normalization or scaling.

3. Feature Engineering: We extract relevant features from the timeseries data that can be used to train predictive models. This may include statistical features, frequency domain features, or time-domain features.

4. Model Training: We train machine learning models using the preprocessed and engineered features. Popular models for timeseries data include recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, or gradient boosting machines (GBMs).

5. Model Evaluation: We evaluate the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC).

6. Predictive Maintenance: Once the models are trained and evaluated, we can use them to predict when a machine or equipment is likely to fail. This allows us to schedule proactive maintenance activities, reducing downtime and improving operational efficiency.
